## 1. What is Data Analysis?

**Definition:**  
Data Analysis is the process of **collecting, inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data** to **discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making**.  

It answers questions like:  
- **What happened?** → Descriptive Analysis  
- **Why did it happen?** → Diagnostic Analysis  
- **What might happen?** → Predictive Analysis  
- **What should we do?** → Prescriptive Analysis

## 2. Explanation of Each Term

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Collecting** | Gathering data from multiple sources before analysis. | Pull sales data from SQL database and customer feedback from Excel surveys. |
| **Inspecting** | Exploring data structure and quality to understand missing values, duplicates, and errors. | Check first 100 rows of sales data; notice missing product categories. |
| **Cleaning** | Fixing errors, filling missing values, and removing duplicates. | Replace blank product category with "Unknown", remove duplicate order IDs. |
| **Transforming** | Converting raw data into structured format suitable for analysis. | Create Profit = Sales – Cost, group daily sales into monthly totals. |
| **Analyzing** | Applying statistical or analytical methods to extract patterns and insights. | Pivot table to calculate total sales per category, chart top 5 products. |
| **Discover Useful Information** | Identify patterns, trends, anomalies for actionable knowledge. | Electronics sales peak in November; high returns in Fashion category. |
| **Draw Conclusions** | Interpret insights in real-world context. | Fashion returns are high due to sizing issues; festive campaigns boost Electronics. |
| **Support Decision-Making** | Recommend actions based on insights. | Improve Fashion quality; target festive campaigns in Electronics. |
